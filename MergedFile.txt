Today is a fine day.
It's my day off.
I think I'll just spend my time doing nothing but watching drama and read novels perhaps.
I love reading.
Reading is a way to get to know about the world.
Because books are the window of the world.
Reading can brings you to the magical fantasy world.
Some of my favorite genre is psychological thriller, comedy romance, adventure, sci-fi, etc.
