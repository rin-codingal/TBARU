                Rendang is an Indonesian spicy meat dish originating from the Minangkabau region in West Sumatra, Indonesia. 
                It has spread across Indonesia to the cuisines of neighbouring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, 
                Brunei and the Philippines. Rendang is often described as a rich Southeast Asian curry that's made by stewing meat 
                in coconut milk and spices until it becomes tender. Rendang is a piece of meat — most commonly beef (rendang daging) — 
                that has been slow cooked and braised in a coconut milk and spice mixture, well until the liquids evaporate and 
                the meat turns dark brown and tender, becoming caramelized and infused with rich spices.

                has produced a wide variety of satay recipes.
