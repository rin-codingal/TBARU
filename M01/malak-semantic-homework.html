                <h1>Dogs</h1>
                <p>
                    Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time.
                    Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the ability to create actual measures of time, 
                    like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks.
                    So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much,
                    but we understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway! 
                    Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, 
                    and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. 
                    Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example of this.

                    The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. 
                    Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, 
                    and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. 
                    Dogs were the first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years 
                    ago before the development of agriculture.

                <h1>Cats</h1>
                <p>
                    The cat, also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, 
                    is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal. 
                    It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. 
                    Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat 
                    occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat,
                    but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. 
                    Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin, 
                    the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. 
                    It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, 
                    and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. 
                    It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. 
                    Cat communication includes vocalizations—including meowing, purring, trilling,
                     hissing, growling, and grunting–as well as body language. 
                     It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, 
                     such as those made by small mammals.It secretes and perceives pheromones.
